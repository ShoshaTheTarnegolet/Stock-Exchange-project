# Stock Exchange project

This is a multipage stock exchange data website. First page is for searching company and second is for company information.
This project is based on [Financial Modeling Prep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/), design is mine.

Here you can find:

1. Fetch API;
2. work with Chart.js;
3. live search with debounce function;
4. multiple promises;
5. marquee, loader

It isn't finished yet: I want to add a compare button and make a compare page.

You can try it [on Netlify](https://stock-exchange-project.netlify.app/)
